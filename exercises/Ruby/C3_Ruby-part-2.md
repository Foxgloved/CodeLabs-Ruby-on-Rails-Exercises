**Exercise 2.1: if/else Conditionals**

1. Print out `What is your name?`. Get user input and store data in a variable called name
2. Use an if statement to see if the name entered by the user is "john". If so, print out `I found you!`.
3. Use an else statement to print out `You're not who I'm looking for ` follow by the name the user entered.
4. Use the built in string method `downcase` to downcase all letters of the user input in case he enters `JoHn`.

6. Add an elsif statement to check if the first name and last name equate to `Amy Jeans`. If so, print `Amy! Help me look for John Doe.`

9. Use `unshift` to add a number to the front of the array. Use `<<` to push a number to the end of the array.
10. Use an iterator to print out each element of the array.
11. Use an the each method to multiply each element in the array by 2 and print it
12. Use the select method to only return odd numbers

**Exercise 2.3: More built in array methods**

1. Print out the array of built in methods

To see the methods
Example `puts [].methods`

- Google them

1. Create an array with three strings that resemble names.
2. Use three different built in array methods that haven't been covered in this exercise.
